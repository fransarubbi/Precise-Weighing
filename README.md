# Precise-Weighing
Precise weighing system for substances, simulated using events generated via buttons. To understand its logic, we recommend viewing the statechart that uses David Harel's formalism. It starts in a wait state; when an event occurs, it begins operating. It has two weighing stages. In the NON-PRECISE state, two valves, C1 and C2, open, allowing a large amount of substance to pass through. In the PRECISE state, only valve C2 opens to define a more precise weight. Then, in the EMPTY state, the scale is discharged until it reaches zero and then returns to the NON-PRECISE state. It runs in a loop in this manner. Errors may occur when the time limit is exceeded in each state, and the system can also be stopped manually. In this case, the last running state can be restored by implementing the state history. Finally, there is an emergency emptying option in case the system needs to be restored.
A circular queue is used for event handling. The sAPI library developed by Eric Pernia is also used. In this case, it is very useful for the LPC4337 board.
